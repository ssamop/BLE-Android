# BLE-Android

The project aims to develop an Android application that utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to
connect to a beacon and detect its location. Similar to the concept of AirTag, the application will provide users with
the ability to track and locate items equipped with Bluetooth beacons. The application will enhance user experience
by providing real-time location updates and notifications when the beacon is within range.

## User Authentication:
• Implemented user authentication using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in
securely.

• Utilized email/password authentication or integrate with popular OAuth providers like Google or Facebook
for streamlined sign-up and login processes.

## Bluetooth Integration and Beacon Connection:
• Implemented Bluetooth functionality to enable the Android device to scan for nearby BLE devices, including
beacons.

• Developed the logic to establish a connection with the beacon detected by the Android device.

## Location Detection:
• Integrated algorithms to detect and estimate the location of the beacon relative to the user's device.

• Utilized Bluetooth signal strength (RSSI) and triangulation techniques to calculate the approximate distance
between the device and the beacon.

• Conducted initial testing in a controlled environment to calibrate the distance estimation algorithm and refine
the positioning system.

## User Interface (UI) Design:
• Designed and implement the user interface for the application, including screens for device discovery, beacon
connection status, and location detection.

• Ensured the UI is intuitive and user-friendly, providing clear feedback on beacon detection and location
updates.
